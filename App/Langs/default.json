  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_GREETINGS": "Welcome to <b>DotDager</b>",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_INTRODUCTION": "Hi, I'm Mariano, also known as Dot Dager. Full-stack/lead developer by day, amateur philosopher by night, and enthusiastic guitarist whenever possible. I'm passionate about programming, creating inspiring content, and questioning what's behind every line of code... and life in general. Lover of cats, pickles (yes, you read that right), and everything that makes me feel like the world makes sense, even if just for a little while.",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_EXTRA_1": "Cats",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_EXTRA_1_DESCRIPTION": "They ignore you as if you owe them money, but at the same time they look at you as if you were their personal slave and they have the unique ability to sit down at the keyboard just when you are doing something important, how can you not love them?",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_EXTRA_2": "Philosophy",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_EXTRA_2_DESCRIPTION": "Philosophy is great for spending hours wondering if a pickle has a soul while it rots in the fridge. And of course, when you understand that \"being is and non-being is not\", you realize that the pickle is still... just a pickle!",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_EXTRA_3": "Pickles",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_EXTRA_3_DESCRIPTION": "Just think about it for a moment, why wouldn't you like pickles? They can fill you up in a number of ways, and I'm not just talking about your stomach. Think of them as an abstract way of living life by being a simple pickles, green and fresh all the time.",

  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_TITLE": "What I do",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_TOPIC_1": "Programming",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_TOPIC_1_DESCRIPTION": "It's like having superpowers, but in a nerdy way. You take an idea, shape it, and suddenly you have something living on the screen, doing exactly what you want... or something close to it. It's a constant challenge: there's always something new to learn or improve. It's addictive because it always leaves you wanting to do something bigger.",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_TOPIC_2": "Content creation",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_TOPIC_2_DESCRIPTION": "Creating content is the best because it allows me to share what I learn, get into interesting discussions and, at the same time, demystify things that seem more complicated than they are. The best thing is my cool, good-natured community, with that spark that motivates you to keep creating. Especially this guy who programmed this cool landing for me.",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_TOPIC_3": "Guitars",
  "DOT_DAGER_LANDING_SECTION_ABOUT_TOPIC_3_DESCRIPTION": "The guitar is like a barbecue of instruments: it can't be missing. Who doesn't like to play some chords believing themselves to be Slash? Every strum has a story, every note is a tremendous piece, and I'm not just talking about the one you like, I'm looking at you. It's as if the strings had a language of their own, one that lets you express yourself without saying a word.",
